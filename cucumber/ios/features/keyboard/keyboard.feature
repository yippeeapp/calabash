    When I type " World!" character by character
    Then the text in the text field should be "Hello World!"
    And I can dismiss the keyboard by touching the Done key

  Scenario: I can ask questions about the keyboard visibility
    And I touch the text field
    Then I wait for the keyboard
    And the keyboard is visible
    And the docked keyboard is visible
    And the undocked keyboard is not visible
    And the split keyboard is not visible

  Scenario: I can clear the text using setText:
    Given I have entered some text in the text field
