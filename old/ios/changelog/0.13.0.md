### 0.13.0 changelog

This release requires a server update.

We've updated the [Updating Your Calabash iOS Version](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/B1-Updating-your-Calabash-iOS-version) page as part of our on-going effort to improve the wiki.

### Summary

This release contains a potential breaking change in the `scroll` gesture.  Previously, it was possible to scroll past the content size of scroll view.  This is something that user cannot do.  Scrolling is now limited to the content size of the scroll view.  Please let us know if this causes problems. Thanks @idcuesta for a stellar pull-request.

We are working hard to make dylib injection a reality.  We made some improvements in run-loop to help stabilize the interaction with lldb.  This feature is still experimental.

We added more support for interaction with UIPickerView classes.  You can now interact with picker using [raw JavaScript calls](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Calabash-iOS-Ruby-API#pickers).
