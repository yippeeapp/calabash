    # A class to represent an iOS application.  An application can be a
    # simulator bundle (.app) or a device binary (.ipa).
    class Application < Calabash::Application

      # The path to the application under test deduced by analysing the
      # environment.
      #
      # You can control the default application path by setting the `CAL_APP`
      # environment variable.  This is the best way of ensuring Calabash
      # can find your application.
      #
      # @todo We have a chicken and egg problem.  If the device under test
      # is a simulator, we have been analyzing the Xcode or Xamarin Studio
      # project for the likely location of the .app.  I think we still want
      # to do this.  The problem is that Xcode buries the .app in a
      # DerivedData directory deep in the user's ~/Library/ and the correct
      # directory path is very difficult to find.  I overcome this problem
      # with command-line build scripts that put the .app (or .ipa) in a
      # directory local to my project.  Others devs use Xcode Custom Build
      # locations.  I don't think we we want to branch here on whether or not
      # the DEVICE_ID points to a simulator or physical device.  This is
      # wicked expensive.
