      # Touches the keyboard delete key.
      #
      # The 'delete' key difficult to find and touch because its behavior
      # changes depending on the iOS version and keyboard type.  Consider the
      # following:
      #
      # On iOS 6, the 'delete' char code is _not_ \b.
      # On iOS 7: The Delete char code is \b on non-numeric keyboards.
      #           On numeric keyboards, the delete key is a button on the
      #           the keyboard.
      #
      # By default, Calabash uses a raw UIAutomaton JavaScript call to tap the
      # element named 'Delete'.  This works well in English localizations for
      # most keyboards.  If you find that it does not work, use the options
      # pass either an translation of 'Delete' for your localization or use the
      # default the escaped keyboard character.
      #
      # @example
      #   # Uses UIAutomation to tap the 'Delete' key or button.
      #   tap_keyboard_delete_key
      #
      #   # Types the \b key.
      #   tap_keyboard_delete_key({:use_escaped_char => true})
      #
      #   # Types the \d key.
      #   tap_keyboard_delete_key({:use_escaped_char => '\d'})
      #
      #   # Uses UIAutomation to tap the 'Slet' key or button.
      #   tap_keyboard_delete_key({:delete_key_label => 'Slet'})
      #
      #   # Don't specify both options!  If :use_escape_sequence is truthy,
      #   # Calabash will ignore the :delete_key_label and try to use an
      #   # escaped character sequence.
      #   tap_keyboard_delete_key({:use_escaped_char => true,
      #                            :delete_key_label => 'Slet'})
      #
      # @param [Hash] options Alternative ways to tap the delete key.
