### Xcode 6 and iOS 8 XTC Support

We are phasing-in iOS 8 on-device support and the results are good.

### Deprecated

See https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Deprecated

##### Upcoming Deprecations

The following classes/modules have been moved to the run-loop gem.  They will be deprecated and replaced with their run-loop equivalents in future releases.

* Calabash::Cucumber::Version
* Calabash::Cucumber::SimulatorAccessibility
* Calabash::Cucumber::XcodeTools
* Calabash::Cucumber::PlistBuddy

### Upcoming Changes

We are exploring deprecating the `calabash_exit` method.  This _might_ break code coverage support.  We think this change will provide a more stable test environment in Xcode 6.

### Apple bugging

Thank you to everyone who is reporting bugs for Xcode 6 GM / iOS 8 GM.  We are working hard to resolve the remaining problems and are waiting for Apple to respond to several open bug reports.
